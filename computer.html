  <h3><center>Hardware Project</center></h3>
  <p>In the hardware project, I was provided with various tasks which can be performed by a device and had to explain
    one of the processes in detail. I chose to work on the topic "The user has a basic painting application open and
    taps on the screen to draw a point". Here is a link which will take you to my <a
      href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10br-XEo1enaqwoSmUrQ5Q60_AAYy0MbxmYMN0eHVz3o/edit?usp=sharing">Hardware
      Project. </a></p>

  <h4>Reflection</h4>
  <p>This project has significantly helped me in understanding the function and synchronization of the computer systems
    and components to fire up multiple pixels to display an output on the screen of a phone. I also learnt about
    different parts of the GPU which I did not know existed prior to this assignment.</p>

  <p>On this topic, I still must learn more about the various components of a electronic device. Since my research was
    mainly focused on phone components, my understandings on the same components in a laptop or a personal computer are
    not quite clear. </p>

  <h4>Responses</h4>
  <p>How might this hardware project have imporved your understanding of computer components? Explain using an example
    of hardware components.<br>
    <red>Before I did this project, I thought that the GPU was one singular unit which renders the output on the screen.
      During my research, i found out about various parts of the GPU which include:</red>
  <ol>
    <red>
      <li>VRAM, which stands for Video Random Access Memory, allows the GPU to transmit data to different internal
        components of the phone. </li>
    </red>
    <red>
      <li>VRM, which stands for Voltage Regulator Module, regulates the voltage current recieved by the GPU and other
        parts of the graphics card by the battery. This charge is regulated to avoid any surge taking place in the
        graphics card.</li>
    </red>
    <red>
      <li>GPU fans and heat syncs which are found in PC's. Mainly used in gaming PC's, It keeps the GPU cool when it
        must render high data.</li>
    </red>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <p>For new students coming into the course, what advice would you give them regarding this particular project?<br>
    <red>Firstly, I would advice them to not get anxious when they are unable to find information on google. If they use
      the right keywords, they will surely find the information they need. I would also suggest them to first make a
      flowchart and write a rough process for the topic they have chosen.</red>

  <h3><center>Problem Solving and Teamwork</center></h3>
  <p>In the Problem Solving and Teamwork presentation, groups were made and were provided with various topics from which
    we had to prepare a presentaion on the topic chosen by our group. My teammates and I worked on the topic. “An
    in-depth detailed comparison between functions of applications, programming languages, and operating systems.” Here
    is a link which will take you to our <a
      href=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14O3Q9I419-M4yD3cBuEQtQtsNGj6xszomZTeafAyQqw/edit?usp=sharing>Problem
      Solving and Teamwork Presentation.</a></p>

  <h4>Reflection</h4>
  <p>From this assignment, I got to know about various types of programming languages I did not know exist. I also
    learnt how programming languages, operating systems and applications work together.</p>

  <h4>Responses</h4>
  <p>What were your personal and team roadblocks/challenges? How did you move through these roadblocks/challenges?<br>
    <red>There was one personal roadblock and one team challenge. The team challenge was that we were unable to find
      criteria to compare our three components. We solved by browsing through the internet. The personal roadblock was a
      big one. I fell sick on the day of the presentation and was unable to present, but fortunately, my teammates
      stepped in for me and did my part.</red>
  </p>

  <p>What advice would you give future students coming into this course about this project?<br>
    <red>Don't get nervous. You are just presenting in front og your peers and teacher. No one is going to judge you. I
      would also advice them to trust their teammates and to let them work at their own pace. No matter how far behind
      in schedule your teammates are, always aim to finish your part within the decided time</red>
