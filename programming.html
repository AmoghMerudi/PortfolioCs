  <h3>Constants/Variables</h3>
  <img src="images/Constants and variables.png" alt="Constants and Variables">
  <p>The Constants or the variables are the heart of the program. They help store the values which help run the code.
    There is a difference between variables and constants is that the values of variables can be changed but the values
    of constants cannot be changed. In other words, variables can be updated while constants can not be updated.</p>
  <p>I have taken the above code from Programming Assignmnet 1, from lines 24-25. In this code, I am declaring a
    variable named mark, which is taking input from the user. The function
    'readline.question' is used to take input from the user. Since it is a variable and not a constant, the input can be
    changed later in the code if required. </p>

  <h3>Conditional (if) Statements</h3>
  <img src="images/Conditional Statements.png" alt="Conditional statements">
  <p>Conditional Statements are used to instruct the computer on the decision to make when given some conditions. These
    decisions are made if and only if the pre-stated conditions are either true or false. One very popular type of
    conditional Statements are if-else if ladders.</p>
  <p>I have taken the above code from Programming Assignment 1, from lines 65- 94. In this code, I am making an if-else
    if ladder which will print the grade of the student based on their
    average marks. If the average is between 100 and 90, their grade will be E. If the average is between 80 and 90,
    their
    grade will be C, and so on. If their average is below 0 or above 100, the conditional statements will return
    "Invalid Input entered. Check the marks entered previously."</p>

  <h3>Repetition Structures (for/while loops)</h3>
  <img src="images/Loops.png" alt="Repetiton Structures">
  <p>Repetition Structures, also known as loops, are used to run a block of code multiple times until a certain
    condition is met. </p>
  <p>I have taken the above code from Programming Assignment 1, from lines 50-53. In this code, I am declaring a for
    loop which will run until the variable 'i' is less than or equal to 'classStrength'. Inside the for loop, I am
    taking input from the user, i.e., the teacher in this case. The teacher will be entering the average marks of each
    student in the class. I am then adding all the student marks and storing it in the varianle 'classAvg'. In like 54
    (which is not visible in the snpshot), I am dividing 'classAvg' by 'classStrength' to find the class average.</p>

  <h3>Built-in Functions</h3>
  <img src="images/Built-in Functions.png" alt="Built-in Functions">
  <p>A built-in function is a function that is already available in a programming language. There are various types of 
    built-in functions in JavaScript which include:  </p>  
  <ol>
    <li>String Functions</li>
    <li>Array Functions</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I have taken the code from Programming Assignment 1, from lines 98-101. In this code, I am taking input from the 
    user, i.e., the teacher. I am storing this input in the variable 'input'. In the last two lines, I am manipulating 
    the strings so that I can run the rest of the code. In line 100, I am using the string function '.trim()'. This 
    function removes any whitespaces at the end of the input. In line 101, I am using the string function 
    '.toUpperCase()'. This function changes all the lower case characters in the string to upper case.</p>
  <hr class="dashed">

  <h3>Custom Functions</h3>
  <img src="images/Custom Functions.png" alt="Custom Functions">
  <p>A custom function is a function which is made by the programmer. This function can only be used in the program it
     is written in. In other words, each custom function is unique. </p>
  <p>I have taken the above code from Programming Assignment 1, from lines 11-37. In this code, I am making a function
     named 'studentMarks' with 2 parameters, i.e., 'studentName' and 'noOfSubjects'. The variable 'studentName' stores 
     the name of the student while 'noOfSubjects' stores the number of subjects the student has. In the function, first 
     I am running an error check which will terminate the code if the number of subjects is less than 0. If the number
      of subjects is not zero, the function runs a while loop which will run until the variable 'i' is equal to the number 
      of subjects. I am using the loop to take input from the user, i.e., the marks in each subject. At the end of the 
      function, I am finding the average marks of the student and displaying it. </p>
  <hr class="dashed">

  <h3>Arrow Functions</h3>
  <img src="images/Arrow Functions.png" alt="Arrow Functions">
  <p>Arrow Functions are an compact alternative to the traditional Functions. It has some differences in the syntax and 
    has limitations.</p>
  <p>I have taken the above code from Programming Assignment 2, from lines 80-95. In this code, I am making an arror 
    function named 'decision1' which has no parameters. In the function, if the userInput is not a part of the array,
     I am asking the user if they would want to add their input to the array. I am them manipulating the string to 
     make it all upper case and removing any extra whitespace present in the end of the string. I am also running
      an error check with the help of a while loop which is seeing if the user input is a string or not. If 
      the user enters any other variable, it will keep asking the user for input until the user enters a string. 
      This was of error checking can be done if, for some reason, the conventional way of error checking, i.e., 
      try and catch doesn't work.</p>

  <h3>Function Documentation</h3>
  <img src="images/Function Documentation.png" alt="Function Documentation">
  <p>Function Documentation is the written information of a function which includes the description of the function, 
    a description of the parameters and return values, along with their datatypes.</p>
  <p>Since my function documentation was not properly done in my asssignments, I have written a different code for
     this. This block of code can be 'script.js', from lines 11-46. In this code the top part is the function 
     documentation. You can see that I have included the information of my parameters and return values. This 
     information contains the name of the parameter or return value, their description and their datatype. 
     The main purpose of the function is too identify the type of word entered by the user in the parameter
      'userInput'. </p>

  <h3>Arrays and Modifying Arrays</h3>
  <img src="images/Arrays.png" alt="Arrays and Modifying Arrays">
  <p>Arrays are like variables but with multiple values, but all the values must have the same values. Arrays 
    can be modified by using Array functions.</p>
  <p>I have taken the above code from Programming Assignment 2, from lines 17-23. In this code, I am declaring 
    an array 'habitats' which as four string values, i.e., "SAVANNAS", "FLOODPLAIN FORESTS", "GRASSLANDS", 
    "SWAMPS". I am then sorting the array by using the '.sort()' array function. To print the array, I 
    am using a for loop. The for loop will go over each index in the sorted array and print them in 
    alphabetical order. </p>

  <h3>JSON</h3>
  <img src="images/JSON Object.png" alt="JSON-style Object Notation">
  <p>JSON stand for JavaScript Object-Notation. It is one of two ways to make an object in JavaScript. They
     are like arrays but can have different data types.</p>
