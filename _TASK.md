# Task(s)

This work is worth 30% of your final mark.  Each OLG is equally weighted (3 x 10 = 30%).

Using your knowledge of HTML and Javascript, create a full website (here) that includes the following components.  A template has been provided for you. As you are filling it out, be sure to remove any placeholders: `Insert _____` before submitting.


## OLG 1 - Computers and Algorithms (`computer.html`)
Include all the following within this page:

### Subheading 1 (`Hardware Project`)
Within this subheading, include the following items:

* The work that was completed from the _Hardware - Project_ submission.
* A `Reflection` section that:
  * highlights what you learned from this assignment, and
  * what you still have to learn about this topic.
* A `Responses` section that answers **two** of the following questions:
  * Q1. How might this hardware project have improved your understanding of computer components? Explain using an example of hardware component(s).
  * Q2. There were portions of the assignment where you could not "Google" the answer. How might this project change your perspective on problem solving? 
  * Q3. For new students coming into this course, what advice would you give them regarding this particular project?

### Subheading 2 (`Problem Solving and Teamwork`)
Within this subheading, include the following items:

* A link to the work that was completed from the _Problem Solving and Teamwork_ submission.
* A `Reflection` section that:
  * highlights what you learned from this assignment, how the teamwork process played out etc.
* A `Responses` section that:
  * Q1. What were your personal and team roadblocks/challenges? How did you move through these roadblocks/challenges?
  * Q2. What advice would you give future students coming into the course about this project?


## OLG 2 - Digital Scholar (`digitalscholar.html`)

### Subheading 1 (`Post-Secondary Opportunities`)
Within this subheading, include the following items:

* The work that was completed from the _Post-Secondary Opportunities_ submission.
* A `Reflection` section that:
  * highlights what you learned from this assignment, and
  * what you still have to learn about this topic.
* A `Responses` section that answers **two** of the following questions:
  * Q1. In the next 5-10 years there will be new jobs that are available and jobs that will disappear. Knowing what you have learned from the assignment, how might you best prepare yourself for the future workforce?
  * Q2. Computing will most likely be part of every job in the future, what skills can you transfer from this course into your future profession? 
  * Q3. In preparation for post-secondary life, what is the one thing about yourself regarding learning skills that you would like to work to improve? Explain your reasoning.


### Subheading 2 (`Emerging Technologies`)
Within this subheading, include the following items:

* The work that was completed from the _Emerging Technologies_ submission.
* A `Reflection` section that:
  * highlights what you learned from this assignment, and
  * what you still have to learn about this topic.
* A `Responses` section that answers **two** of the following questions:
  * Q1. If your emerging technology were fully realized today, how might life be different?
  * Q2. If you were sent back in time 1000 years, how might you explain your emerging technology to the locals?
  * Q3. How might future technology not negatively impact the natural environment?



## OLG 3 - Programming (`programming.html`)
Include all the following within this page. Include a snippet of your own code and corresponding explanation about why this is an **exemplary** piece of code.

* Constants/Variables
* Conditional Statements (if statements)
* Repetition Structures (for/while loops)
* Built-in Functions
* Custom Functions
* Arrow Functions
* Function Documentation
* Arrays
* Modifying Arrays  
* Error Handling
* JSON-style Object Notation
* External Libraries

### Q&A
  
Create questions, and include a sample answer, for each of the following topics. Your questions **must** start with one of: "Why will", "Why would", "Why might", "Why should", "How will", "How would", "How might", **or** "How should":
  * Constants and variable
  * If statements
  * Loops
  * Functions
  * Arrays
  * Error Handling


## Evaluation

* in OLGs 1 and 2, one `Reflection` and one `Responses` each will be randomly selected for assessment (but not from the same assignment).
* in OLG 3 two code segments and explanations will be randomly selected, as well as one set of questions from the `Q&A` section.
