  <h3><center>Post Secondary Opportunities</center></h2>
    <p>In the Post-Secondary Opportunities assignment, we were to discuss about the post-secondary opportunities of a
      career of our choice. I chose to work on the career of a Theoretical Physicist. Here is a link which will take you
      to my <a

        Opportunities</a></p>

    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    <p>In this assignment, I mainly learnt about how to become a /theoretical physicist. For this assignment, I also put
      in my previous knowledge of good universities which offer exceptional courses in physics. +
    </p>

    <p>Although I know a lot on this. I'm still curious on how many people who aim to beomce a theoretical physicist
      actually beomce one. I'm also curious about the acceptance rate of the schools.</p>

    <h4>Responses</h4>
    <p>In the next 5-10 years there will be new jobs that are available and jobs that will disappear. Knowing what you
      have learned from this assignment, how might you best prepare yourself for the future workforce?<br>
      <red>
        Recently, just after Google released its own AI,it fired over 30,000 employees! This is an example of how AI is
        taking over the job market. So yes, there will be new jobs available, but some jobs will dissapear. To prepare
        myself for the future workforce, I am aiming to work in a field which provides help in the functioning of these
        AI models, for example, an Artificial Intelligence. This way, there is a very small chance that I may lose my
        job to AI.

    <p>In preparation for post-secondary life, what is the one thing about yourself regarding learning sjill that you
      would like to work to improve?<br>
      <red>
        I would personally love to not procrastinate. Even though I end up handing in all my assignments on time, I do
        most of them at the very last possible moment which would cost me dearly for university assignments.

    <h3><center>Emerging Technology</center></h3>
    <p>In this assignment, I had to explore an emerging technology. I chose to work on Artificially Intelligent
      Governor, which I did not know existed before this assignment, Here is a link which will late you to my <a
        href='https://www.figma.com/file/Y2LXLp0u92y2Q9GiZSz1dv/Emerging-Technologies?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=1vGcBqJZ358GoJXD-1 '>Emerging
        Technologies Assignment</a>.</p>

    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    <p>In this assignment, I learnt about various technologies which I did not know were possible to make. I also found
      out the various ways AI is being used in the modern world.I also learnt how to properly find articles on topics
      which are new and not many people are aware about them. </p>
    <p>I would also like to learn how these advanced techs are made and maintaned. As far as I know, tech like these
      would require a lot of care and maintenance. I'm also curious about how bug the servers for such technologies. And
      even if they manage to make such technologies, will limited countries be given the priviledge to use them or will
      anyone be able to use them?</p>

    <h4>Responses</h4>
    <p>If your emerging technology were fully realized today, how might life be different?<br>
      <red>
        Firstly, there would be no biases in governance. Everyone would be treated equally and it is possible that the
        AI makes more calculated and plannec decisions. It would also improve the governance. The AI model can also
        process automation, computerization of records etc, which wil reduce the man hours spent by humans to do these
        tasks. An AI governor would be flawlessly fair, since any course of action would be logical, driven only by the
        relevant rules of law and the facts at hand.
      </red>
    </p>

    <p>How might future technology not negatively impact the natural environment?<br>
      <red>
        There may be some future technologies which may not impact the natural environment, but instead help develop the
        environment. For example, solar roofs, smart city planner, using virtual reality to spread awareness, etc. Since
        it is an AI model, it won't require transportation which would reduce the gas emissions which are release by
        human governors' vehicles. It can also suggest better, more practical and budget friendly ways to save the
        environment.
